# pubsub
Simple backend in Go to try and make a pubsub mechanism using scyllaDB, websockets and a front end with SvelteKit.

PS: I don't know what I'm doing I'm still a beginner with Go that's why it's probably looks like s*** for people actually writing Go professionally (If you want to give me some tips or anything don't hesitate to drop an issue)
